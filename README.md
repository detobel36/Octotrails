# [qControl](https://qcontrol.be)

All transportation stops need to be inspected by a MIVB/STIB controller. The controller needs to write everything down and put it into an Excel sheet. The whole process is inefficient and time-consuming.

To make the controller's life easier, our team Octotrails designed an easy web application for collecting data on the stops. No double work anymore, but an easy to answer, centralized with extra functionalities.

Our app will ease out the stop control process and make it more efficient and meaning.
One of its major advantages is focusing on the accessibility of the stops (outside and inside the station) by asking different questions to the user.
